Blender 3D Basics Hub


Unlock the power of 3D creation with Blender!


Project Overview


This repository showcases my journey through the basics of Blender 3D, covering various aspects of 3D modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation. With a collection of practical exercises and projects, I've demonstrated my understanding of Blender's interface, tools, and techniques.


Technologies Used


- Blender 3D: 3D creation software for modeling, texturing, lighting, and animation
- Python: Scripting language for Blender's API



Key Concepts


- Blender's interface and navigation
- 3D modeling (vertices, edges, faces, extrusions)
- Texturing and materials (UV unwrapping, mapping)
- Lighting (types, properties, and effects)
- Animation (keyframes, paths, and physics)


Getting Started

2. Explore the practicals and projects folders
3. Open the Blender files (.blend) using Blender 3D software
